### Phase 5: Ecosystem Growth

Version: 1.0 • Owner: PM/DevRel • Duration: Ongoing

Purpose: Scale adoption through advanced features, analytics, tooling, and community programs.

----

### Scope
- Advanced features (batch registration, multi-sig support)
- Analytics for creators and marketplaces
- Automation (auto-registration services where possible)
- Community governance discussions
 - Atlas enhancements (variable tiling, residual layers, optional k-of-n share modes)
 - On-chain libraries ecosystem (community PRs, third-party libs building on Embers Core/Atlas)

----

### Deliverables
- Advanced SDK features and API endpoints
- Creator analytics dashboard (registrations, revenue, conversion)
- Upgrade monitor for parser versions
- Community docs and templates
 - Advanced atlas modes and example repos
 - Library contribution guide and compatibility test suite

----

### Tasks

- Advanced validation
  - [ ] Multi-sig and multi-output fee support
  - [ ] Transfer verification helpers (ownership chain summaries)

- Analytics & reporting
  - [ ] API endpoints for metrics aggregation
  - [ ] Dashboard UI and exports (CSV/JSON)

- Tooling & automation
  - [ ] Auto-registration service patterns (opt-in)
  - [ ] Webhooks for status changes and new registrations
  - [ ] Atlas optimizer (min-cut tiling, dedupe across collections)

- Community & ecosystem
  - [ ] Parser Explorer web tool for testing txids/inscription IDs
  - [ ] Sample integrations for major marketplaces
  - [ ] Governance proposal drafts for fee standards
  - [ ] Library compatibility suite: ensure third-party libs remain interoperable with parents

----

### Acceptance Criteria
- 3+ marketplace integrations using SDK
- 10+ creator collections onboarded
- Active community contributions (PRs, issues, docs)

----

### Risks & Mitigations
- Fragmentation of standards → Publish clear specs; maintain reference templates; compatibility suite
- Privacy concerns around analytics → Aggregate metrics; opt-in telemetry
