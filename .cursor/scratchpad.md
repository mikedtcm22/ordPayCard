# SatSpray Membership Card - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The SatSpray Membership Card project is a Bitcoin ordinals-based membership system that requires:

- Frontend web interface with wallet integration
- Backend API for authentication and verification
- Bitcoin/ordinals integration for signet and mainnet
- Privacy-focused manual flows alongside automated wallet connections
- Real-time balance polling and status updates
- Self-contained ordinal inscriptions with embedded logic

The project prioritizes simplicity, security, and decentralization with minimal server-side state storage. Development progresses through distinct phases, each building toward a cohesive, functional product.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Enhanced Validation**: OP_RETURN binding, provenance receipts, parser parity
2. **Last-Transfer Awareness**: Prevent activation with stale receipts after ownership change
3. **On-chain API Library**: Embers Core v1 with size budget constraints
4. **Client/Server Parity**: Consistent parser behavior across environments

### Architecture Considerations:
- Decentralized design with ordinal inscriptions as source of truth
- Bitcoin signet for development, regtest for testing
- TDD methodology with RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycles
- Fail-closed behavior for security-critical operations

#### Track E: Tooling & Examples — Planner Breakdown

##### Micro-task E1 — `bitcoin-cli` OP_RETURN examples
- **Goal**: Provide canonical, copy-pasteable CLI commands to construct a fee transaction embedding OP_RETURN data `<NFT_ID>|<EXPIRY_BLOCK>` that pays the creator address, for regtest/signet/testnet/mainnet.
- **Scope**:
  - End-to-end raw tx flow with `fundrawtransaction`/`walletcreatefundedpsbt` and `OP_RETURN` output.
  - Canonicalize OP_RETURN encoding and parameter placeholders; include expiry rationale and validation notes.
  - Network-specific notes (fee rates, address formats); troubleshooting section for common errors.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `docs/testing/opreturn-bitcoin-cli-examples.md` with sections: Overview, Prereqs, Regtest walk-through, Signet/Testnet notes, Mainnet cautions, Troubleshooting.
  - Tests (RED→GREEN): `server/src/__tests__/docs.e1.examples.test.ts` validates file presence and that examples include `<NFT_ID>` and `<EXPIRY_BLOCK>` placeholders and an OP_RETURN output.
- **TDD**:
  - RED: Failing Jest test asserting doc exists and contains required markers and a code block with `OP_RETURN`.
  - GREEN: Author the doc with minimal, accurate examples that satisfy the test.
- **Success criteria**:
  - New doc is discoverable and passes tests; examples execute on regtest as written (with placeholder replacement).
  - Explicit cross-links to parser rules and status API behavior.
- **Risks**: Wallet/CLI version differences; mitigate via version notes and alternatives section.

##### Micro-task E2 — Wallet troubleshooting guide
- **Goal**: Help users succeed when their wallet cannot add OP_RETURN or deviates from required encoding by providing clear alternatives and verification steps.
- **Scope**:
  - Supported wallet matrix and OP_RETURN capability notes.
  - Alternatives: raw PSBT/CLI builder path (link to E1), manual verification steps to confirm OP_RETURN and payment amount.
  - Common errors and fixes; FAQs.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `docs/testing/wallet-troubleshooting.md` with sections: Supported wallets, Alternatives, Raw builder flow, Verification, FAQ.
  - Tests (RED→GREEN): `server/src/__tests__/docs.e2.troubleshooting.test.ts` checks presence and section headings listed above.
- **TDD**:
  - RED: Failing Jest test asserting doc exists and includes required section headings.
  - GREEN: Author the guide minimally to satisfy tests; iterate as needed.
- **Success criteria**:
  - Users can complete a registration by following either a supported wallet path or the raw builder fallback.
  - Guide cross-links to E1 examples and status API debug fields to validate outcomes.
- **Dependencies**: E1 examples referenced by E2; reuse network setup from existing SIGNET/TESTING docs.
- **Risks**: Wallet UIs change; mitigate by focusing on principles and CLI fallback.

## Lessons
## Documentation/Process Tasks Queued (from D1–D3 Refactor Notes)

These are deliberately deferred and not part of the current code task plan. Keep in queue for a later documentation-focused pass.

- **API docs generation**: Evaluate and wire up TypeDoc; add `docs:api` script; enrich JSDoc with `@example` blocks.
- **Public API test locking (docs/process)**: Author guidance on snapshot test maintenance and contract test workflow.
- **Changelog tooling**: Consider conventional commits + changelog generator; document release process.
- **Shared fixtures documentation**: Document server/client shared fixture approach and parity guarantees.
- **Build reporting docs**: Write guidance for interpreting size reports and visualizer artifacts.
- **Loader developer guide**: Document checksum mode, caching behavior, and failure modes; add troubleshooting.

### Phase 2 Development Insights
- **TDD Discipline**: Small, focused tests prevent overengineering and ensure complete requirements coverage
- **Parser Parity**: Client/server consistency requires identical test cases and deterministic results
- **Fail-Closed Design**: Security-critical operations default to safe state when dependencies fail
- **Cache Strategy**: 30s TTL balances performance with data freshness for inscription metadata
- **Module Resolution**: Vitest and Vite configs must stay synchronized for consistent import handling
- **Template Integration**: Error boundaries needed for EmbersCore API calls; async timing critical for diagnostics
- **Debug Implementation**: PII sanitization must apply recursively to inputs and outputs; JSON serialization requires BigInt conversion
- **Deduplication Logic**: Order-preserving uniqueness with graceful fallback for missing utilities
- **Async Testing**: Template functions triggered by events require explicit waiting for async completion in tests
- **Jest Test Isolation**: Express server startup during tests causes hanging; NODE_ENV=test check prevents server startup in test mode
- **TDD Automation**: forceExit and detectOpenHandles in Jest config eliminate manual intervention during test runs
- **Cache Testing Strategy**: Observable behavior tests (timing, response identity) more reliable than fetch mocking for integration testing
- **Cache Validation**: Existing implementation already met requirements; comprehensive tests confirmed TTL and isolation behavior
- **Linter Automation**: ESLint config converted to .cjs format resolves ES module conflicts; all 'any' types replaced with 'unknown' for type safety

### Technical Decisions
- **OP_RETURN Format**: `<nftId>|<expiryBlock>` canonical encoding
- **Provenance Window**: Configurable K parameter (default: 1 block)
- **Size Budget**: Parent HTML ≤ 5KB, library in shared inscriptions
- **Network Support**: Regtest primary, signet for integration, mainnet for production
- **Registration Deduplication**: Template uses `EmbersCore.dedupe` for order-preserving feeTxid uniqueness

### REFACTOR Notes for B2
- **lastRegistration JSON Shape**: Current implementation returns first unique registration object; future enhancement should standardize `{feeTxid, amount, schema, ...}` structure across client/server APIs
- **Error Handling**: Template gracefully falls back when EmbersCore.dedupe fails or is unavailable
- **Performance**: O(n²) lookup acceptable for small children arrays; consider Map-based optimization for larger datasets

### REFACTOR Notes for B3
- **Debug Keys**: `window.__debug` contains `{lastInputs, lastOutputs, timestamp, provenance?}` with sanitized data
- **PII Avoidance**: Filters out `buyer_email`, `buyer_name`, and variations; applies to both inputs and outputs recursively
- **Serialization**: BigInt values converted to strings for JSON compatibility; handles nested object sanitization
- **Timing**: Debug attachment occurs after all async operations complete for accurate diagnostic capture
- **Security**: Debug object only created when `DEBUG=1` or `DEBUG=true`; explicitly removed when `DEBUG=false`
- **Performance**: PII filtering has O(n) complexity per object; acceptable for debug-only usage

### REFACTOR Notes for C1
- **Cache Centralization**: Current in-route cache should be extracted to shared utility for reuse across endpoints
- **Metrics Integration**: Add request timing, cache hit ratio, and parser utility performance metrics
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error responses and add structured logging for debugging
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for timeouts, cache TTL, and network endpoints should be centralized
- **Network Abstraction**: ord endpoint calls should be abstracted into service layer for easier testing and mocking
- **Response Optimization**: Consider partial response caching to reduce computation for frequently accessed debug fields

### REFACTOR Notes for C1 - Error Handling (Completed)
- **Error Categorization**: Consider adding more specific error codes (e.g., `INSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND`, `CACHE_ERROR`) for better granularity
- **Error Logging**: Add structured logging when errors occur to help with debugging and monitoring
- **Error Response Consistency**: Consider adding timestamps to error responses for debugging correlation
- **Performance**: Current error handler creates new error objects which is fine, but could consider factory pattern for common errors
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for all error codes and their meanings to improve maintainability
- **Type Safety**: Create TypeScript types for error responses to ensure consistency across the API

### REFACTOR Notes for C2
- **Centralized Cache Service**: Extract status cache into shared `CacheService` class with TTL management, LRU eviction, and metrics
- **Test Strategy Evolution**: Observable behavior testing proved more reliable than network mocking; standardize this pattern for integration tests
- **Cache Monitoring**: Add cache hit/miss ratio logging and performance metrics for production monitoring
- **Cache Configuration**: Make TTL configurable per cache type (status: 30s, metadata: 5min, etc.) through environment variables
- **Memory Management**: Consider implementing cache size limits and automatic cleanup for long-running processes
- **Cache Warming**: Add optional cache pre-warming for frequently accessed NFT IDs to improve initial response times

### REFACTOR Notes for E1 - bitcoin-cli OP_RETURN Examples
- **Example Variety**: Add more network-specific examples with actual addresses for each network type
- **Script Automation**: Consider adding bash script examples that automate the entire flow
- **Error Recovery**: Add examples of RBF (Replace-By-Fee) for stuck transactions
- **PSBT Workflow**: Expand PSBT examples with multi-sig and hardware wallet scenarios
- **Validation Tools**: Add examples using `bitcoin-cli validateaddress` and transaction simulation
- **Size Optimization**: Document OP_RETURN size limits (80 bytes standard, up to 83 bytes with OP_PUSHDATA)
- **Cross-Platform**: Add Windows PowerShell equivalents for hex encoding commands
- **Integration Examples**: Show how to integrate with popular wallet libraries (bitcoinjs-lib, etc.)

### REFACTOR Notes for E2 - Wallet Troubleshooting Guide
- **Wallet Updates**: Maintain current wallet compatibility as new versions release
- **Video Tutorials**: Consider adding links to video walkthroughs for visual learners
- **Script Repository**: Create companion repository with ready-to-use scripts
- **Internationalization**: Translate guide to other languages for wider adoption
- **Interactive Debugger**: Build web-based tool to decode and validate transactions
- **Community Examples**: Add section for community-contributed solutions
- **Hardware Wallets**: Expand coverage for Ledger, Trezor, and other hardware wallets
- **Mobile Wallets**: Add mobile-specific troubleshooting for iOS/Android wallets
- **API Integration**: Document programmatic registration via popular Bitcoin libraries
