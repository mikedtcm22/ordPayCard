# SatSpray Scratchpad History - Phase 1 Completion

## Archive Date: 2025-01-15

This file contains the completed Phase 1 work that has been archived from the main scratchpad.

## Phase 1: Setup Phase - COMPLETED ✅

**Duration**: July-August 2025  
**Status**: All 5 features completed successfully

### Feature 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup ✅
- ✅ Initialize monorepo structure with client/ and server/ directories
- ✅ Set up package.json files with core dependencies (React, TypeScript, Express)
- ✅ Configure Vite for frontend development server
- ✅ Set up TypeScript configuration for both frontend and backend
- ✅ Create basic npm scripts for development and build processes

### Feature 1.2: Basic Frontend Shell ✅
- ✅ Create React app structure with routing setup
- ✅ Implement basic layout components (Header, Footer, Main)
- ✅ Add Tailwind CSS configuration and basic styling
- ✅ Create placeholder pages for main flows (Home, Auth, Top-up)
- ✅ Set up basic state management with Zustand

### Feature 1.3: Basic Backend API ✅
- ✅ Set up Express server with TypeScript
- ✅ Configure middleware (CORS, JSON parsing, basic security)
- ✅ Create basic route structure for auth and membership endpoints
- ✅ Set up basic error handling and logging
- ✅ Create health check endpoint for monitoring

### Feature 1.4: Bitcoin Integration Foundation ✅
- ✅ Set up bitcoinjs-lib integration for testnet/signet
- ✅ Create basic Bitcoin service class with network configuration
- ✅ Implement basic address validation functions
- ✅ Set up ordinals API client for inscription fetching
- ✅ Create basic PSBT creation utilities

### Feature 1.5: Development Environment ✅
- ✅ Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- ✅ Set up Jest/Vitest for testing framework
- ✅ Create basic development documentation
- ✅ Set up environment variable management
- ✅ Create basic Docker configuration for containerization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Achieved
- Monorepo structure with separate client/server packages
- TypeScript throughout with strict type checking
- React 19 with Vite build system
- Express.js backend with comprehensive middleware
- Bitcoin/ordinals integration foundation
- Docker containerization ready

### Testing Infrastructure
- Client: Vitest + @testing-library/react (16 tests passing)
- Server: Jest + supertest (143 tests passing)
- Total: 159 tests with comprehensive coverage

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Bitcoin Network**: Signet for development, testnet/mainnet for production
- **Wallet Integration**: Temporary SimpleWalletButton due to ord-connect issues
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- **API Design**: RESTful with consistent error handling

## Issues Resolved

### ord-connect Package Issues
**Problem**: @ordzaar/ord-connect package had export configuration issues preventing application startup
**Solution**: Created temporary SimpleWalletButton component with simulated wallet connections
**Status**: Workaround implemented, production solution deferred to Phase 2

### CI Workflow Issues
**Problem**: npm workspace install failures and Jest version incompatibilities
**Solution**: 
- Changed CI to use root package-lock.json installation
- Pinned Jest to v29.7.0 and ts-jest to v29.1.1
- Fixed all linting violations (16 errors resolved)
**Status**: ✅ Complete - CI pipeline fully operational

## Environment Setup Results
- **Node.js**: v22.17.1 (NVM managed)
- **npm**: v10.9.2
- **Git**: v2.47.1
- **Platform**: macOS 23.6.0
- **All requirements verified and exceeded**

## Lessons Learned

### Development Best Practices
- Phase-based development ensures each iteration delivers value
- Limiting features to 5 steps maximum forces proper breakdown
- Early testing integration prevents technical debt
- Monorepo structure with workspace management simplifies development

### Technical Insights
- Bitcoin library integration requires careful network configuration
- PSBT creation utilities need dummy UTXO support for testing
- Ordinals API clients need robust retry logic and timeout handling
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement catches issues early

### Tooling Decisions
- Vitest provides better React testing experience than Jest for client
- ESLint + Prettier combination maintains code quality
- Docker containerization supports both development and production
- Environment variable validation prevents configuration errors

## Success Metrics Achieved
- **Development Speed**: 5 features completed in planned timeframe
- **Code Quality**: 159 tests passing, 0 linting errors
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and contribution guides
- **Infrastructure**: Full Docker + CI/CD pipeline operational
- **Bitcoin Integration**: Foundation ready for ordinals development

## Ready for Phase 2
All Phase 1 deliverables complete. Project foundation provides:
- Robust development environment
- Bitcoin/ordinals integration capabilities
- Testing infrastructure
- Production-ready containerization
- CI/CD pipeline with quality gates

**Phase 2 can begin immediately with wallet integration and membership card creation.**
