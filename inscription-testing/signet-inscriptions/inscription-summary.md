## What I've Prepared

1. **Base Inscription Template** (`test1_base_card.min.html`)
   - Size: 8,417 bytes (8.2 KB)
   - Treasury: `tb1pjqfzx3qye9hhgf0h7w9d5vhxfgjv7hgw56yp6xttz7t6h3kc8h3s0x49wn`
   - Decay Rate: 100 sats/block
   - Balance Calculation: Fixed (no double-decay bug)

2. **Key Features**
   - Self-contained HTML with embedded SVGs
   - ES5-compatible JavaScript
   - Active (green) and Expired (red) visual states
   - Real-time balance display
   - No external dependencies

## Ready for Inscription

The template is ready to be inscribed on Signet. You can use:

1. **Unisat Web Interface** (recommended)
   - Go to https://unisat.io/inscribe
   - Switch to Signet network
   - Upload the file: `signet-inscriptions/test1_base_card.min.html`
   - Send to your wallet address

2. **Local Preview First**
   - Open the HTML file in your browser to see how it looks
   - It will show "EXPIRED" state with 0 balance (expected)

## After Inscription

Once you've created the inscription, I'll need:
- The inscription ID (looks like: `<txid>i<index>`)
- The transaction ID

Then we can:
1. Query it via Hiro API to verify it's indexed
2. Plan the child inscription strategy for adding receipts
3. Test the balance decay mechanism on the live blockchain
