Phase 2: Template Validation Results
=====================================
Date: August 2, 2025

## Test Results Summary

### Task 2.1: Verify Base Template Structure

1. Template Size: 13,485 bytes (13.17 KB)
   - Status: ⚠️ WARNING - Exceeds optimal 10KB but within 50KB maximum
   - Recommendation: Consider optimizing/minifying for production

2. External Dependencies: ✅ NONE FOUND
   - No HTTP/HTTPS URLs detected
   - No CDN references
   - Template is fully self-contained

3. SVG Assets: ✅ 2 EMBEDDED (Active and Expired states)
   - SVG_ACTIVE: Circuit pattern with green gradient
   - SVG_EXPIRED: Broken circuit pattern with red gradient

4. cardStatus Function: ✅ PRESENT
   - Function is properly exposed on window object
   - Returns balance, blocksRemaining, and status

### Task 2.2: Test Template in Browser

1. HTTP Server Test: ✅ PASSED
   - Template loads successfully via HTTP
   - No console errors detected
   - HTML structure renders correctly

### Balance Calculation Logic

The updated balance calculation now properly handles multiple receipts:
- Sorts receipts chronologically
- Maintains running balance total
- Applies decay from last activity block only
- Correctly handles multiple top-ups

### Phase 2 Conclusion

✅ Template validation PASSED with minor size warning
- Template is functional and self-contained
- Balance calculation logic has been fixed
- Ready for browser-based testing

### Next Steps

1. Obtain Hiro API key for Phase 3 testing
2. Run automated inscription tests
3. Optimize template size if needed for production
